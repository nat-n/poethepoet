Standard task options
=====================

Overview
--------

The following options can be configured on your tasks and are not specific to any particular task type.

**help** : ``str`` | ``int`` :doc:`ðŸ“–<../guides/help_guide>`
  Help text to be displayed next to the task name in the documentation when poe is run without specifying a task.

**args** : ``Dict[str, dict]`` | ``List[Union[str, dict]]`` :doc:`ðŸ“–<../guides/args_guide>`
  Define CLI options, positional arguments, or flags that this task should accept.

**env** :  ``Dict[str, str]`` :ref:`ðŸ“–<Setting task specific environment variables>`
  A map of environment variables to be set for this task.

**envfile** :  ``str`` | ``List[str]`` :ref:`ðŸ“–<Loading environment variables from an env file>`
  Provide one or more env files to be loaded before running this task.

**cwd** :  ``str`` :ref:`ðŸ“–<Running a task with a specific working directory>`
  Specify the current working directory that this task should run with. The given path is resolved relative to the parent directory of the ``pyproject.toml``.

**deps** :  ``List[str]`` :doc:`ðŸ“–<../guides/composition_guide>`
  A list of task invocations that will be executed before this one.

**uses** :  ``Dict[str, str]`` :doc:`ðŸ“–<../guides/composition_guide>`
  Allows this task to use the output of other tasks which are executed first.
  The value is a map where the values are invocations of the other tasks, and the keys are environment variables by which the results of those tasks will be accessible in this task.

**use_exec** : ``bool`` :ref:`ðŸ“–<Defining tasks that run via exec instead of a subprocess>`
  Specify that this task should be executed in the same process, instead of as a subprocess.

  .. attention::

    This option is only applicable to **cmd** and **script** tasks, and it implies the task in question cannot be referenced by another task.


Setting task specific environment variables
-------------------------------------------

You can specify arbitrary environment variables to be set for a single task by providing the env option like so:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.poe.tasks.serve]
    script = "myapp:run"
    env = { PORT = "9001" }

Notice this example uses deep keys which can be more convenient but aren't as well supported by some older toml implementations.


Setting defaults for environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous example can be modified to only set the `PORT` variable if it is not already set by replacing the last line with the following:

.. code-block:: toml

    env.PORT.default = "9001"


Templating environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to reference existing environment variables when defining a new environment variable for a task. This may be useful for aliasing or extending a variable already defined in the host environment, globally in the config, or in a referenced envfile. In the following example the value from $TF_VAR_service_port on the host environment is also made available as $FLASK_RUN_PORT within the task.

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.poe.tasks.serve]
    cmd = "flask run"
    env = { FLASK_RUN_PORT = "${TF_VAR_service_port}" }


Loading environment variables from an env file
----------------------------------------------

You can also specify one or more env files (with bash-like syntax) to load per task like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    # .env
    STAGE=dev
    PASSWORD='!@#$%^&*('

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.poe.tasks]
    serve.script  = "myapp:run"
    serve.envfile = ".env"

The envfile option accepts the name (or relative path) to a single envfile as shown
above but can also by given a list of such paths like so:

.. code-block:: toml

    serve.envfile = [".env", "local.env"]

In this case the referenced files will be loaded in the given order.


Running a task with a specific working directory
------------------------------------------------

By default tasks are run from the project root â€“ that is the parent directory of the pyproject.toml file. However if a task needs to be run in another directory within the project then this can be accomplished by using the :toml:`cwd` option like so:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.poe.tasks.build-client]
    cmd = "npx ts-node -T ./build.ts"
    cwd = "./client"

In this example, the npx executable is executed inside the :sh:`./client` subdirectory of the project, and will use the nodejs package.json configuration from that location and evaluate paths relative to that location.


Defining tasks that run via exec instead of a subprocess
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally tasks are executed as subprocesses of the ``poe`` executable. This makes it possible for poe to run multiple tasks, for example within a sequence task or task graph.

However in certain situations it can be desirable to define a task that is instead executed within the same process via an *exec* call. :doc:`task_types/cmd` and :doc:`task_types/script` tasks can be configured to work this way using the :toml:`use_exec` option like so:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.poe.tasks.serve]
    cmd      = "gunicorn ./my_app:run"
    use_exec = true

.. warning::

  Note the following limitations with this feature:

  1. a task configured in this way may not be referenced by another task
  2. this does not work on windows becuase of `this issue <https://bugs.python.org/issue19066>`_. On windows a subprocess is always created.
