Preface
~~~~~~~

If you’re willing to contribute your ideas and effort to making poethepoet
better, then that’s awesome and I’m grateful. I don’t have all the answers so
it’s particularly important for this project to benefit from diverse
perspectives and technical expertise.

However please be aware that a lot of thought has gone into the architecture of
poethepoet, and whilst I know it’s not perfect, and I am very interested in
alternative perspectives, I do have strong (and I hope reasonable) opinions
about how certain things should work. This particularly applies to naming and
internal APIs. There is a lot to consider in terms of making sure the tool stays
simple, flexible, and performant. So please don’t be offended if there is some
push back.

Development process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If your planned changes entail non-trivial UI or internal API changes then
   it’s a good idea to bring them up for discussion as a
   `GitHub issue <https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet/issues>`_ first.

2. Fork and clone the repo, and create a feature or bugfix branch off of the
   *development* branch.

3. Double check that you’re starting from the *development* branch, and not from
   the the *main* branch.

4. Run ``poetry install`` to setup your development environment.
   (`install poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`__)

5. Do your code.

6. If you’ve added a feature then before it can be including in a release we
   will need:

   a. a feature test along the same lines as the examples in the tests dir,
   b. to update documentation.

5. Run ``poe check`` to check that you haven’t broken anything that will
   block the CI pipeline.

6. Create a commit with a clear commit message that describes the commit
   contents.

7. Open a PR on GitHub.

Pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There isn’t currently a pull request template, but please try and be descriptive
about what problem you’re solving and how, and reference related issues.

In some cases it might be acceptable to merge code to *development* to make a
pre-release from it without including full automated tests and documentation.
However this is a special case, because it blocks further releases from the
*development* branch until the tests and docs are there.

Branching model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project implements something like git flow.

*TL;DR* branch off of *development* for new features, or *main* for minor bug
fixes or doc improvements.

We like to keep a clean history, so squash-rebase merges are preferred for the
*development* or *main* branches.

Overview of branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Historic branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **main** the primary branch containing released code and up to date docs.
-  **development** in progress and pre-released features that are expected to be
   included in a release when ready.

Working branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **hotfix/** branches for minor/urgent bug fixes from main
-  **feature/** branches for new feature development from development
-  **bugfix/** for new bug fixes from development
-  **doc/** branches for documentation changes

How to add a new feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create your branch from *development*

   ::

      git fetch
      git checkout origin/development
      git checkout -b feature/my_new_feature

2. Create a pull request back to *development*

How to add a hot fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create your branch from *main*

   ::

      git fetch
      git checkout origin/main
      git checkout -b feature/my_new_feature

2. Create a pull request back to *main*, and one to *development*

How to create pre-release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the head of the *development* branch, create release commit that
   bumps the version in ``pyproject.toml`` and ``__version__.py``
   (there’s a test to ensure these are in sync).
2. Create a release (and tag) on GitHub, following the existing
   convention for naming and release notes format, and the GitHub CI
   will do the rest.

How to create release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a branch off of *development* like **release/1.0.0** and add a
   commit to bump the version in ``pyproject.toml`` and
   ``__version__.py``.
2. Merge it into both *main* and *development*
3. Create a GitHub release from the head of main, following the existing
   convention for naming and release notes format, and the GitHub CI
   will do the rest.
