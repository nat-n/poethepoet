## Features


- âœ… Straight forward declaration of project tasks in your pyproject.toml

- âœ… Tasks are run in poetry's virtualenv (or another env you specify)

- âœ… Shell completion of task names (and global options too for zsh)

- âœ… The poe CLI can be used standalone, or as a [plugin for the poetry](https://poethepoet.natn.io/poetry_plugin.html)

- âœ… Tasks can be commands, shell scripts, python expressions, or references to python functions

- âœ… Concise commands with extra arguments passed to the task `poe [options] task [task_args]`

- âœ… Easily define CLI arguments for your tasks

- âœ… Tasks can specify and reference environment variables, even without a shell

- âœ… Tasks are self documenting, with optional help messages (just run `poe` with no arguments)

- âœ… Tasks can be composed into sequences or DAGs

- âœ… Works with `.env` files


## Quick start

1. Install the Poe the Poet via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) or [another method](https://poethepoet.natn.io/installation.html).

  ```sh
  pipx install poethepoet
  ```

2. Define some tasks in your **pyproject.toml**

  ```toml
  [tool.poe.tasks]
  test         = "pytest --cov=my_app"                         # a simple command task
  serve.script = "my_app.service:run(debug=True)"              # python script based task
  tunnel.shell = "ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:8080:$PROD:8080 $PROD &"   # (posix) shell based task
  ```

3. Run your tasks via the CLI

  ```sh
  $ poe test -v tests/unit # extra CLI arguments are appended to the underlying command
  Poe => pytest --cov=my_app
  ...
  ```

If you're using poetry, then poe will automatically use CLI tools and libraries from your poetry managed virtualenv without you having to run `poetry run` or `poetry shell`

Poe can also be [used without poetry](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html#usage-without-poetry).
